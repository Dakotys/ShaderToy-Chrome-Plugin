# ShaderToy unofficial plugin.

[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shadertoy-unofficial-plug/ohicbclhdmkhoabobgppffepcopomhgl?hl=pl)

## Features:

* Switchable dark color theme.

* Sorting shaders list by views, likes or comments on "My profile" page.

* Change resolution in windowed and fullscreen mode by pressing keys 1...9.

  Resolution is divided by pressed key value, for example:

  Key '2' divides by 2, 1920x1080 becomes 960x540.
  Key '8' divides by 9, 1920x1080 becomes 240x135.

  This allows to run shaders smoothly (even in fullscreen) on non-top GPUs.
  Notice that lower resolution is interpolated to original size. This causes blurrish rendering. For pixelated image, rendering mode switch has been added.

* Pause/Restart in fullscreen mode.

* Fullscreen edit mode.
